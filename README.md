Javascript Game Engine
============

Sleeps as much as possible to maintain desired FPS. Drops frames when behind and doesn't drop below a minimum frame rate.

Tested on an average computer with hundreds of sprites with full collision testing (box) on an HTML canvas and easily maintained 30fps with over 90% sleep time.
